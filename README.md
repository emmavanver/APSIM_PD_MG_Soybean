# Optimum soybean planting date x maturity group

This repository contains the R code used to run APSIM simulations directly from R, as utilized in the paper titled: "Integrating Field Data and a Modeling Approach to Inform Optimum Planting Date × Maturity Group for Soybeans under Current and Future Weather Conditions in Kansas."

## Steps to Follow:
1. Obtain site/trial information.
2. Download weather data from Mesonet.
3. Download soil data from SSURGO.
4. Add soil data to APSIM.
5. Add weather data to APSIM.
6. Run the simulations in APSIM.
