# Optimum soybean planting date x maturity group

This repository contains the R code used to run APSIM simulations directly from R, as utilized in the paper titled: "Integrating Field Data and a Modeling Approach to Inform Optimum Planting Date × Maturity Group for Soybeans under Current and Future Weather Conditions in Kansas."

## Steps to Follow:
Obtain site/trial information.
Download weather data from Mesonet.
Download soil data from SSURGO.
Add soil data to APSIM.
Add weather data to APSIM.
Run the simulations in APSIM.
